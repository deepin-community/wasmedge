wasmedge (0.13.5+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.
    - Drop patch llama-cpp-gcc-13, was an upstream backport.
    - Add new symbols to libwasmedge0.symbols.
    - Update debian/copyright to reflect a source tree move.
  * Drop zlib1g-dev build dependency, as this was for LLD, which has now
    gained the build dependency itself. (cf. #1047718)
  * Mark the embed-cxx autopkgtest as flaky, as clang++-16 is currently buggy
    and cannot compile code for the wasm32-wasi target. (cf. #1052002)

wasmedge (0.13.3+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.
  * Drop libboost-all-dev dependency, as Boost was dropped as a dependency in
    the 0.13.0 release.

    (Closes: #1042193)

wasmedge (0.13.1+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.
    - Drop several precompiled wasm files from Files-Excluded, as these have
      been dropped upstream at our request (see upstream #1869).
    - Add new symbols to libwasmedge0.symbols.
  * Drop wasmedgec, replaced upstream by "wasmedge compile".
    - Rename the manpage to wasmedge-compile(1) and adjust all references in
      wasmedge(1).
    - Adjust the package description & autopkgtests to refer to "wasmedge
      compile" (and "wasmedge run", where applicable) instead.
    - Stop shipping /usr/bin/wasmedgec.
  * autopkgtests: fix a failure in the "capi-wasi-env" test when build with a
    newer rustc, that ships with rust-lld -> lld-15, while llvm-defaults is
    still pointing to lld-14. See the inline comment and/or git commit message
    for more details.
  * Upload to unstable.
